# ~/.dotfiles

## About this repository

This repository contains my personal configuration files. This is very much a work in progress because I just recently switched to i3wm, I'm discovering and configuring programs as I learn about them.

I'm using [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) (rc file management) to manage my config files, that's why there's no dot in front of them in this repository.

## How to use the dotfiles

You need to have rcm installed and you can then just:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlqnK/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
rcup
```
Even though you really should just copy the interesting parts manually instead of trying to use the all thing.
